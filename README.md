## Websocket Livecode

Mainly used [Socket.io](https://socket.io) as a Websocket platform but Socket.io does much more than just websockets.

### Authentication

I do not deal with authenticating users through websockets, you can find more information about that here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19548009/user-authentication-using-socket-io

[socketio-jwt](https://github.com/auth0-community/socketio-jwt)
[jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)

### Demo

`nodemon server.js`
